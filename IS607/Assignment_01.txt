Hi my name is Vuthy. I currently reside in Long Island.

I stumbled into Data & Analytics at my job a few years ago so I've been working with data for a couple of years now. I am interested in this program because I wanted to get a more formal education in the field vs learning on the job. I am hoping this program will help strengthen my knowledge of statistics and analysis.

If I can find the time, I would love to dedicate my time to do some woodworking.

Hi everyone, my name is Sonya.  I am from Queens, majored in sociology and I work with data as a Business Intelligence analyst. I hope to be able to improve my math skills, use Hadoop and add R & Python to my toolbox.  I like to read for fun and relaxation.
